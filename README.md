## Why does the script work
This is a script I wrote from a silly idea me and my friend had.
Lightshot, the free screenshot tool available for Windows and MacOS stores the screenshots the users make on their website public for anyone to access.
This does make sense on their end, because the screenshots will be shared and it doesn't make sense to make them private.
But this adds a major flaw: Since anyone can access them, anyone can get the information stored in them.
This is a script which generates random links for random screenshots from lightshot webpage, downloads the images and stores them.
I have only used it for about 300 photos and got some interesting things people have shared with eachother:
- Bitcoin accounts (I'm pretty sure they are scams, account Georgian33 appears everywhere)
- Various Student Accounts on different school sites.
- Bank Accounts: I obviosly wasn't going to log into them but the only thing that was stopping me was the three numbers on the back of the card.

## How does the script work
Languages Used:
- Python version 3.8

Libraries Used:
- random
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- urllib.request
- html5lib
- shutil
- string
- os
- json

As mentioned above, it generates random six-letters values to access random screenshots. It uses library 'requests' to access the page and gets the raw HTML file. Then BeautifulSoup is used to get the image URL from the HTML code, then it is downloaded and saved locally in folder `./images/` using shutil.
One thing I want to say is that I'm not that good with commenting my code, apologizes if I didn't do it properly.

## Setup

First install these libraries if you haven't installed them:
- bs4
- html5lib
- requests
- Other Libraries (should) come with python by default.

The main file will generate two other files in the same directory it's stored:
- data.json: It stores used URLs to avoid duplicates every time you run the script
- ./images/ dir: Where all images will be stored after downloading.
Warning: 
I am using linux, which uses forward slash(`/`) for paths, This will probably work on Windows as well but I'm not entirely sure.

## Disclaimer
I give no warranty or take no responsibility or liability for any harm caused by this script. Under no circumstances I will be held responsible in any way for any claims, damanges, losses, costs or liabilities whatsoever. This is shared only for educational purposes only and I do not encourage anyone to use it to harm or take information that it doesn't belong to them or they aren't authorised to use.

## Future Plans:
If I continute this project, I would like to add an AI that detects usernames/emails and passwords in the photos and stores them somewhere else.
(Maybe even automaticially email them to tell they need to change their account password?)
